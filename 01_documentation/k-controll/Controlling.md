# Controlling

When following the exact step-by-step process outlined in IPERKA, the controlling phase typically occurs towards the end of a project. Despite its placement in the project timeline, having a comprehensive testing protocol is crucial. Not only is it a client expectation, but it also serves as a valuable tool to assess the functionality of the product and identify any potential flaws. Throughout our project, we consistently addressed issues promptly, especially after implementing new code. Regular testing was an integral part of our improvement process.

## How We Conducted Testing

Upon receiving confirmation from our software developer that the product was finalized with no further changes expected, the assigned project administrator took charge of testing. The administrator then completed a testing protocol, meticulously crafted by the head of administration in documents. The testing process was designed around two distinct scenarios.

## 1. Scenario:

John Doe, embodying the persona of a casual player interested in video games, tested the game. John, with a decent gaming experience, utilized a standard working laptop and approached the game with an enthusiasm for new gaming experiences. Being aware that this was a school project, John expressed satisfaction with the game.

## 2. Scenario:

Jane Doe, a software developer with a high-end PC, eagerly benchmarked the game. She explored various settings on her powerful PC and formulated her opinion. Jane quickly observed the game's resilience to high graphical settings, expressing her satisfaction with the overall performance.

## Testing Protocol

Establishing a testing protocol was essential to define the parameters for our evaluation process. We formulated high-quality testing requirements that aligned with our expectations for the game's functionality. As mentioned previously, the end product underwent multiple minor testing sessions. Our current objective was to evaluate the game from a user's perspective.

## Why is a Testing Protocol Important?

A testing protocol serves as a comprehensive tool, offering the client insights into the product's behavior. Beyond providing an overview of what works well and areas for improvement, it also aids developers in identifying flaws or bugs within the system.

## Procedure for Effective Testing

The designated team member for this task initially familiarized themselves with the template provided in the testing protocol. Subsequently, the tester systematically filled out each column in the template. The process began by outlining expectations for the output, followed by rigorous testing on the specific topic. A brief description of the result was documented in the "Received Output" column before assigning a status to the topic. Once a topic was thoroughly checked and completed, the revising team member's name (in our case, Gabriel) was recorded in the "Revised" column.

## What If?

Given the complexity of projects, the likelihood of encountering bugs is close to unavoidable. Even major websites, games, and software regularly address and fix bugs. As a team, we made a strategic decision due to time constraintsâ€”we documented identified issues in this protocol without immediately fixing them to avoid the risk of exacerbating larger problems.

## Problems Experienced During Testing

One specific issue arose where all enemies clustered together unexpectedly. Although this behavior wasn't planned, the situation resolved itself naturally after a certain in-game event. While not the intended behavior, we decided to leave it as is since it didn't pose a significant problem and addressing it could risk unintended consequences.
