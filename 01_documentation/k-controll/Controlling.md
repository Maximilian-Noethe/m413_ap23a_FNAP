## Controlling

If you follow the exact step by step of IPERKA the controlling part is near the end of a project. Nevertheless having a testing protocoll is very important to have. Not only because most clients like to see one but also it's good to see if a product does work and where flaws are. For our project as a whole we always improved flaws and issues right after implementig new code. In this sense we also tested the game regularly. 

## How did we test?

As soon as our software developer gave us the call that the product is finished and no further changes will be made, the assigned project administrator tested the product and filled in the information in the the testing protocoll made by the head of administration in documents. The product was tested thinking of 2 possible scenarios.

# 1. Scenario:
John Doe testing the game as a casual player intersted in video games. In our idea John Doe has a decent gaming experience, a normal working laptop and an aspiration for new games. John Doe understands that this is a school project and is satisifed about the game.

# 2. Scenario:
Jane Doe is a software developer with a high-end PC who is desperate to benchmark the game as one. She takes through different settings on her PC and creates her opinion. Quickly she realizes that the game resists high graphical settings. She is also satisified.

## Testing Protocoll

To realize what we even want to test, we had to create a testing protocoll in order to do that. We kept the testing requirements high class and checked on upon our expectatons of how the game should work. As mentioned previously the end product already went through some minor testing sessions and now our was to test the the game in the view of an user.
