# Controlling

When following the exact step-by-step process outlined in IPERKA, the controlling phase typically occurs towards the end of a project. Despite its placement in the project timeline, having a comprehensive testing protocol is crucial. Not only is it a client expectation, but it also serves as a valuable tool to assess the functionality of the product and identify any potential flaws. Throughout our project, we consistently addressed issues promptly, especially after implementing new code. Regular testing was an integral part of our improvement process.

## How We Conducted Testing

Upon receiving confirmation from our software developer that the product was finalized with no further changes expected, the assigned project administrator took charge of testing. The administrator then completed a testing protocol, meticulously crafted by the head of administration in documents. The testing process was designed around two distinct scenarios.

## 1. Scenario:

John Doe, embodying the persona of a casual player interested in video games, tested the game. John, with a decent gaming experience, utilized a standard working laptop and approached the game with an enthusiasm for new gaming experiences. Being aware that this was a school project, John expressed satisfaction with the game.

## 2. Scenario:

Jane Doe, a software developer with a high-end PC, eagerly benchmarked the game. She explored various settings on her powerful PC and formulated her opinion. Jane quickly observed the game's resilience to high graphical settings, expressing her satisfaction with the overall performance.

## Testing Protocol

To define the parameters for our testing, the creation of a testing protocol was imperative. We set high-class testing requirements aligned with our expectations for how the game should function. As mentioned earlier, the end product underwent several minor testing sessions. Our goal now was to assess the game from a user's perspective.
