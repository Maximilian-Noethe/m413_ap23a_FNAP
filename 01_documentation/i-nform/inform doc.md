## Inform

As we received the information that we are going to work on an assignment, we started with a brainstorming session to sort our thoughts in a kind of way so that we can make sure that we can decide the best idea.
After we decided that we want to create a game, there were a hundred of things that we had to discuss. Such as what tool do we want to use, what is the goal of the game, what are features of it etc. 
We kept informing us via the internet and from knowledge that we already had. The assignment had some requirements that had to be fulfilled and for that reason we also thought about them in an early stage. 
To be honest we did not have a lot of problems by choosing our IDE which was “Blender” for the animation part and “Unity” for the game development. 
Our information resulted that these tools are the most suitable for our kind of project which contains a lot of 3D modelling features. After we set the base of knowledge that was needed, we could really move on with planning.  
We realized that lots of the information part also may contain elements of other parts of “IPERKA” such as taking decisions. For us as a team the information part wasn’t the biggest part of the project yet, but we understand that it is the base for a good project.
