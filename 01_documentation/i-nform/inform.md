## Inform

As soon as we received the information that we would be working on an assignment, we initiated a brainstorming session to organize our thoughts in a structured manner. This was crucial to ensure that we could collectively decide on the best idea. Upon concluding that we wanted to create a game, numerous aspects needed thorough discussion, ranging from the choice of tools to defining the game's goal and features.

We continuously gathered information through internet sources and drew from our existing knowledge. Given that the assignment had specific requirements that needed to be met, we considered them early in the planning process. Fortunately, we encountered minimal challenges in selecting our IDEs, opting for 'Blender' for animation and 'Unity' for game development.

Our research indicated that these tools were most suitable for our project, which heavily involves 3D modeling features. With a solid foundation of necessary knowledge, we could proceed with detailed planning.

We recognized that the informational aspect of our project might overlap with other components of 'IPERKA,' such as decision-making. While, as a team, the information part did not constitute the largest segment of our project, we acknowledged its pivotal role as the bedrock for a successful project

## Sources of inspirement

Initially, our inspiration stemmed from the horror game 'Five Nights At Freddy's,' where the objective is to survive five nights in a haunted restaurant overrun by malfunctioning robots. Drawing from our shared enthusiasm for the third-person shooter game 'Fortnite,' we aimed to blend elements from both games, adding a unique twist to our project. Consequently, we delved into researching how we could seamlessly integrate aspects of these two games with each other.

## Goals
For our project, we've established three SMART goals to provide structure to our ambitions and guide the development process. These goals serve as a vision for the project, offering a reference point for control and assessment throughout its lifecycle.

#1st Goal: Collectibles and Escape

*Specific:* Players must collect three in-game items to obtain a key, allowing them to escape the haunted restaurant, evading Peely and his army.

*Measurable:* Define clear criteria for collecting each item, ensuring players have a tangible objective for progression.

*Achievable:* Set a balanced difficulty level to make the task challenging yet feasible for players.

*Relevant:* Align the goal with the overall narrative, making the escape from Peely's haunted restaurant a pivotal part of the gaming experience.

*Time-bound:* Establish a specific timeline or milestone for achieving this goal within the project schedule.

#2nd Goal: Monster Implementation

*Specific:* Implement four regular monsters and one special end boss, each contributing to the logical structure of the game.

*Measurable:* Clearly define the abilities and characteristics of each monster, providing measurable challenges for players.

*Achievable:* Balance the difficulty to offer engaging gameplay without making it overly strenuous.

*Relevant:* Integrate the monsters seamlessly into the game narrative, with the end boss serving as a climactic challenge.

*Time-bound:* Set deadlines for monster implementation to maintain progress within the project timeline.

#3rd Goal: Prioritizing Functionality Over Graphics

*Specific:* Prioritize the functionality and smooth operation of the application over high-end graphics.

*Measurable:* Establish criteria for functional success, focusing on smooth gameplay, minimal bugs, and reliable performance.

*Achievable:* Concentrate on developing a robust foundation for the game before allocating resources to graphics, considering the challenges of 3D game development.

*Relevant:* Align the decision with budget constraints and the practicality of developing a 3D game, ensuring a pragmatic approach.

*Time-bound:* Set milestones for functionality, ensuring that core mechanics are in place before allocating significant resources to graphics.

These goals provide a comprehensive framework for our project, ensuring a clear path towards successful development and implementation. Regular assessments and open communication within the team will further contribute to achieving these objectives.
