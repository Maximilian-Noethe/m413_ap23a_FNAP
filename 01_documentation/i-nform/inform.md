## Inform

As soon as we received the information that we would be working on an assignment, we initiated a brainstorming session to organize our thoughts in a structured manner. This was crucial to ensure that we could collectively decide on the best idea. Upon concluding that we wanted to create a game, numerous aspects needed thorough discussion, ranging from the choice of tools to defining the game's goal and features.

We continuously gathered information through internet sources and drew from our existing knowledge. Given that the assignment had specific requirements that needed to be met, we considered them early in the planning process. Fortunately, we encountered minimal challenges in selecting our IDEs, opting for 'Blender' for animation and 'Unity' for game development.

Our research indicated that these tools were most suitable for our project, which heavily involves 3D modeling features. With a solid foundation of necessary knowledge, we could proceed with detailed planning.

We recognized that the informational aspect of our project might overlap with other components of 'IPERKA,' such as decision-making. While, as a team, the information part did not constitute the largest segment of our project, we acknowledged its pivotal role as the bedrock for a successful project

## Sources of inspirement

Initially, our inspiration stemmed from the horror game 'Five Nights At Freddy's,' where the objective is to survive five nights in a haunted restaurant overrun by malfunctioning robots. Drawing from our shared enthusiasm for the third-person shooter game 'Fortnite,' we aimed to blend elements from both games, adding a unique twist to our project. Consequently, we delved into researching how we could seamlessly integrate aspects of these two games with each other.

## Goals

For our project we had to set goals in order to get more structure into our ambitions and the project as a whole. In this sense we decided on three smart goals that should give us kind of a vision for the project and where we can also look back to in the control part and asses part later on.
