## Decision

Decisions are very important and must be made in every project. For our specific project we did have to take decisions as well, but we we're quite cooperative in a kind of way that we really accepted eachother ideas and jsut added some sort of complementation to it. In this sense we made document such as task lists, decision logs and even decision matrixes. But we didn't only take decisions referring directly to the realisations part of the project but also on the social part. 
By that I mean that we sometimes had to figure out when we could work most efficently and collaborative, who does which part of the project, are there any external factors or decisions to be considered, and so on.
There we actually realized that the decisions part of the project, also has a influence ont eh planning part and lastly on the realization part and it goes both ways.
However, an important part of the decison part where the documents and I want to loose a word or two about them. 

## Matrix Model
A matrix model is needed to take bigger decisions. Now in our case, where we are developing a 3D game, an important decision is which tools we are going to use. We decided Blender as a designing tool and unity as our game engine. Why did we do that? You may well ask. We could choose the pro and cons of them tools regarding our Matrix Model. What are our priorities? Which performance should they have? What do we actually need? Do we have any experience and so on.
In summary the matrix model really helps to decide when comparing two options with eachother.

## Decision Log

A decision log is good for tracking nearly to every decision you make. Honestly, it is a little difficult to back track on every decision as we didn't write all of them down as we should've. The reason for that is that we were unsure if it is really productive to do so because there were a couple of decision to make and it's soemtimes hard to prioritize the important ones over the "quick yes or no" ones.
To disinguish them isn't that easy we realized. So for this time we will cover up some important decisions made but not to big to be on a Matrix table. Such as how many characters should the game have, what are the collectibles, how should the map look like and so on.
I think that it's a good base to look out to our information part of the documentation as we even there had to take first decisions.

In summary I can say that I see single parts of the IPERKA model mixing up into smaller logs throughout the project. I can say that because for us atleast it wasn't so static as we first believed it could've been.
