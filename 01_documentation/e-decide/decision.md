## Decision

Decisions play a role in every project, and our specific project was no exception. We navigated through a collaborative decision-making process, where we not only accepted each other's ideas but also provided complementary input. To facilitate this, we created documents such as task lists, decision logs, and decision matrices.

Our decision-making wasn't limited to the technical aspects of the project; we also addressed social considerations. This involved determining the most efficient and collaborative times for work, assigning specific tasks to team members, and considering external factors that might impact our decisions. We consider ourselves to be effective decision-makers. Often, we found ourselves in agreement with each other. On the occasions when we didn't, we strived to find a compromise that everyone could accept. Of course, all the ideas that drove these decisions were aimed at improving our project, and ultimately, they were in our shared interest.

We realized that the decisions made during the project had a reciprocal influence on both the planning and realization phases. The relationship between decision-making, planning, and implementation is dynamic and interconnected.

A noteworthy aspect of the decision-making process was the documentation, and I'd like to elaborate on that.

## Matrix Model
A matrix model is essential for making significant decisions. In our case, developing a 3D game involved a crucial decision regarding the choice of tools. We deliberated and ultimately decided on using Blender as our designing tool and Unity as our game engine. The question naturally arises: Why these choices? The answer lies in our careful consideration of the pros and cons of each tool, aligning them with our Matrix Model.

We assessed our priorities, determining the specific performance criteria that were crucial for our project. Factors such as functionality, compatibility, and our team's existing experience played a vital role in this decision-making process. The matrix model provided a structured framework to compare the options side by side.

In summary, the matrix model proved invaluable in guiding our decision-making by systematically comparing two options against each other.

## Decision Log

A decision log proves beneficial for tracking nearly every decision made during a project. However, candidly, it can be challenging to retroactively trace every decision, especially when we didn't document all of them as thoroughly as we should have. The uncertainty stemmed from questioning the productivity of documenting every decision, given the multitude of choices to make. Prioritizing between important decisions and those requiring a quick 'yes or no' added complexity to the process, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

To address this, we've chosen to document crucial decisions that are significant but not large-scale enough to be included in a matrix table. Examples include determining the number of characters in the game, defining collectibles, deciding the appearance of the map, and so on. This approach serves as a pragmatic compromise.

Looking at our information part of the documentation, we find it to be a good reference for our initial decisions. In summary, I observe that individual components of the IPERKA model integrate into smaller logs throughout the project. Contrary to our initial belief, our approach has been more dynamic than we anticipated.
