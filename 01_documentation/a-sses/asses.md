# Assessment

Conducting an assessment after completing a project is a crucial step as it provides an opportunity to reflect on successes and areas for improvement. It's important to acknowledge that perspectives may vary among team members. The following sections aim to highlight key points.

## What went well?

The team demonstrated strong communication throughout the project. Members were committed to creating a high-quality outcome to secure a favorable grade. This commitment translated into a collaborative environment where ideas aligned with the team's goals, and everyone was receptive to suggestions. Despite having a planned workflow, the team recognized the importance of flexibility. The dynamic nature of the team allowed for effective task distribution, ensuring that most, if not all, aspects were covered within set deadlines.

## Areas for improvement in future projects

One notable challenge was underestimating time constraints. The team occasionally spent more time than necessary on tasks, impacting overall project efficiency. In the initial stages, there was a learning curve in understanding how to effectively utilize GitHub. This posed a minor challenge, particularly at the project's outset. While progress was made in mastering the administrative aspects of GitHub as the project progressed, there is room for improvement in time management.

## Strategies for improvement next time

Given the varied perspectives within the team, addressing the GitHub learning curve is a common theme. To mitigate time wastage, a suggested solution is to invest more time in informing and training team members on GitHub's functionalities from the project's inception. This proactive approach could enhance overall efficiency and collaboration. Acknowledging and learning from the challenges faced in the current project lays the groundwork for a more streamlined process in future endeavors.

## Karol:

This project went really well, in my opinion. I enjoyed how we were able to seamlessly transition into our roles. Since there weren't any significant disagreements, selecting something wasn't difficult, and we could finish it quickly. I also thought highly of the team as a whole; we got along great and collaborated well all the time. Apart from Unity occasionally making mistakes, I don't think I have anything to be upset about. However, I have never worked with a more driven and diligent team on a project or simply for any kind of work.
