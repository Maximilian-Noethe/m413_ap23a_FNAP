# Plan
Planning a project is one of the most important steps to complete before even starting the project. Especially with a big or complicated project like we have, it is important to plan every step to avoid obstacles and risks.
After learning about our project and agreeing on a few things already, we were ready to move on to the next step, which was planning. To make our planning easier and keep it clear, we created a task list and a Gantt chart to help us work through our project step by step.

## Planning and what's important for us
Before we could embed all our tasks into different data, we first had to define the right tasks. In this step it was very important to us that there would not be a case where one person had to do a lot for the project and another person had to do almost nothing. As we are a group of 3 people, we did not know at the beginning who should do what, as it is difficult to divide the project for 3 people. 

In the end, we decided that Karol would do all the coding while Gabriel and Maximilian would split the documentation and administrative tasks between them. This way Karol will be able to focus on the programming and Gabriel and Maximilian will have enough time to document the whole project step by step.

## Tasklist
The tasklist is probably the most important thing we need to know what our next steps are in the project. The tasklist serves to show us what we have to do, by when these tasks should be finished and who is responsible for the individual tasks.
The compilation of the different tasks went very well and we quickly knew what we had to do. However, our first task list was not very detailed, but we optimised and expanded it over time. Each task was written down in more detail and broken down into smaller tasks.

The next step was to divide the tasks in the team. We knew roughly who should do which part, but it was still a challenge to divide the smaller tasks among us. We made sure that everyone was happy with their tasks and that no one had too much or too little to do. 
Since we wanted to implement all the ideas we had listed in the "Inform" step, all our tasks were assigned with the highest priority. In the process of implementation we have added additional tasks to our task list that we will implement once we have our base for the game and have completed everything else.

The working times for each task varied and were less in line with our planning, as did the dates by which our tasks were due to be completed. Some tasks took longer than planned, while others took much shorter. 
In the end, the task list helped us a lot to stay structured and to take new actions when problems arose. However, to have a visual overview of our project, we created a Gantt Chart.

## Gantt Chart
The Gantt Chart shows our different tasks and their chronological order with bars. Every single task of ours is represented by a bar and the length of the task depends on the size of the bar. We had to create a Gantt Chart because we are a team of 3 people, yet it helped us a lot in visualising project timelines and coordinating tasks. Even if we were not a team of 3 people, the Gantt Chart would be a very big help.

Creating a Gantt Chart is also not very difficult. In our case we did it in Excel, but there are other possibilities. We listed all our tasks, made a horizontal list with the start date of the project up to the end date of the project and filled in the necessary bars for each task individually.
As we had planned some tasks wrongly, we could not stick to them 100%, but the Gantt Chart helped us to have an overview of our project.

# Risks
Risks and problems will always be a part of a project and you will never be able to avoid them 100%. We also had problems that we had to fix, but you only learn from these mistakes and know what you have to do better in the next project.

During the planning of our project, we encountered risks several times that prevented us from having a successful conclusion. We were able to avoid most of the risks right from the start, but one of them, time management, was partly our undoing. It wasn't a big problem because we knew it was going to be a problem, so we were able to deal with it and get everything done in time because we planned everything a bit earlier so that we would have enough time for everything at times like this.
