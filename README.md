# Introduction
Welcome to the repository of the "Five Nights At Peelys" project by Karol, Max, and Gabriel. Our team dedicatedly developed a 3D game from the ground up, employing the IPERKA management method to ensure the delivery of a high-quality product that aligns with the client's vision. This repository includes comprehensive documentation detailing the various aspects of the assignment.

### Karol
Hello, I'm Karol. For the major part of this project, I worked on the realization document, the game, and the 3D models. I proposed creating a horror game inspired by Fortnite and FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's). I wanted our team to stand out from the others and take on a challenging task, but we also had to know that we could succeed in completing it.

### Maximilian
Hey guys, I'm Maximilian and with my mate Gabriel I am responsible to edit our Github and do the documentation part for our project.
